# Cloud Computing RMIT Assignment 1

Php application prints the Fibonacci Sequence to a txt file in my gcloud bucket. Amount of numbers printed in the sequence is dependent on the users input.

User then inputs 3 numbers. First two numbers will be added, then multiplied by the third. This number will then be added to the total sum of the Fibonacci Sequence read from the bucket and the average given for all numbers.
